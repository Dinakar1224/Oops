        "The five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans.1.Class: A blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that the objects created from the class can have.\n",
        "\n",
        "1.Object: An instance of a class. Objects are the actual data structures created using the class blueprint. They represent specific real-world entities and have the properties and behaviors defined by their class.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "2.Encapsulation: The concept of bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit or class. Encapsulation also involves restricting access to certain details of an object’s internal structure and exposing only what’s necessary (through public methods).\n",
        "\n",
        "3.Inheritance: A mechanism where a new class (subclass) derives properties and behaviors from an existing class (superclass). This allows for reusability of code and the creation of a hierarchy of classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.Polymorphism: The ability for different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through a shared interface. It allows objects to be processed differently depending on their class, even if they share the same method name. Polymorphism is often seen in method overriding or overloading.\n"
